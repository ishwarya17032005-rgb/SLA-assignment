            <article><h1> Intro
            </h1>
            <p>In the early years of Cook’s tenure, Apple introduced no all-new products but rather brought out new versions of previous products, such as the iPhone 4S, which contained a personal assistant program, Siri, that could respond to spoken commands and questions (2011); the iPad Mini, a smaller version of the iPad (2012); and the iPad Pro, a large version of the iPad intended for business use (2015).

In 2014 Apple made its largest acquisition by buying the headphone manufacturer and music-streaming company Beats by Dre, founded by music producer Dr. Dre and music executive Jimmy Iovine, for $3 billion.

Also in 2014, the company launched ApplePay. The app revolutionized mobile payment systems and altered consumers’ views of digital transactions, functioning like a convenient and secure digital ATM card.

In 2015 Apple introduced a smartwatch, the Apple Watch, which marked the company’s entry into wearable technology. Integrating fitness, health monitoring, and online and iPhone connectivity, the Apple Watch became a major business segment within the company’s expansive suite of products.

AirPods, a set of wireless earphones, were introduced in 2016 and became a top seller in the market. And in 2018, Apple launched the HomePad, a smart speaker controlled by Siri designed to compete with Amazon’s Alexa virtual assistant.

Propelled by the popularity of the iPhone, in 2018 Apple became the first company to reach a market capitalization of one trillion dollars. Two years later Apple doubled that figure, another first.

In 2020 Apple introduced its own microprocessor, the M1, for Macintosh computers, which had previously used Intel chips. The M1 was one of the fastest microprocessors available and was designed to be fast while also using less power than previous chips. The company subsequently released updated versions of the M1 chip: the M2 in 2022, the M3 in 2023, and the M4 in 2024.

From 2020 to 2023, Apple launched a series of product upgrades for multiple product lines, from its iPhone 14 to its Mac computers. In January 2025, Apple entered the final stages of verifying its first U.S.-made processor chips at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s plant in Arizona for use in Apple devices.

Apple’s history from a Silicon Valley garage start-up to a trillion-dollar tech titan reads like an epic saga with the twists and turns of a corporate thriller. From its early rivalry with IBM to its current position of market dominance, Apple has innovated and transformed the technological landscape by challenging established notions of what a product is, how it should work, and how it can be integrated into our daily lives (both at home and work). Apple’s trajectory can perhaps best be summarized by its iconic 1997 slogan, created when the then-struggling company was poised at the crossroads of self-reinvention: “Think different.”

    <p>The all-new iPhone Air is so impossibly thin and light that it nearly disappears in your hand. At 5.6 millimetre and weighing just 165 grams,4 it’s the thinnest iPhone ever — even with a large, immersive 16.63 cm (6.5″) display5 and the power of the A19 Pro chip. It’s a paradox you have to hold to believe.</p>
